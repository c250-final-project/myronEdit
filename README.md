05/09/17 THURSDAY UPDATE:
I have included Justin's updated code into the Master main along with Yan Yan's existing code for payroll. With Justin's code we can now add as many employees to a text file as many times as we want. 














I created a Menu implementing YanYan's code and Justin's code and my code
Hey guys, I was really blown away with what YanYan had done and Justin's code and wanted to find a way to combine a template for what we have so far. I clearly see how much hard work it all was. You guys are awesome. I tried to make a master of all of our code put together and the files I uploaded are the result. It's still in a work in progress, and most of it is YanYan's code. I will be updating them as I try to develop more code this weekend and next week. If anyone else has developed code please feel free to upload and I will try to combine them as well. Also, if any of you don't like the formatting this way I am of course open to redesign:)
